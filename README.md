# number-guessing
In this program, the computer will generate a random number and the player will try to guess what that number is. For each guess the player gets wrong, the program will inform them whether the right answer is higher or lower than their guess. They will then be asked to guess again until the get it right. After the player gets the right answer, the computer will display a message saying "You got it right in "X" amount of guesses." and "Thank you for playing!"

Also before the game starts, the program will ask the player if they would like to participate. The player is then given a choice to accept or decline (this choice will end the program right away). Also after each game the program will ask the player if they want to play again.
